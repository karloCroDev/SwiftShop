This is a full-stack shopping application built with Next.js and Firebase. It provides users with a platform to browse, add items to their cart, and put them in favorite section, and make purchases seamlessly. Firebase is utilized for authentication, database management, and storage, ensuring a secure and scalable application. 

Quick note: I didn't use STRIPE api instead I thought more as COD (Collect On Delivery). None of the products are real, and you can't make any payments (however I store your order in DB)!
Also this app is mobile responsive, so you can use it freely on any device (see the following images)
